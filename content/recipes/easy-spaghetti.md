howtomake:
  ingredients:
    - Spaghetti
    - Olive Oil
    - Extra virgin olive oil and fresh garlic
    - Spices (Pepper, Salt, Paprika, etc.)
    - Tomato Sauce
    - Shredded Parmesan Cheese
  instructions: "Cook spaghetti: Fill a large Dutch oven or pot with cold water
    3/4 full and bring to a boil. Add 2 tsp salt and spaghetti. Ensure pasta
    does not stick together: Separate pasta with tongs a few times during the
    first 2 minutes of cooking to ensure it does not stick. Keep cooking
    uncovered for 5 more minutes or until al dente, stirring occasionally. Drain
    pasta: Test the spaghetti for doneness towards the end by grabbing one
    strand onto a plate with tongs. Do not overcook until too soft. The key to
    tasty pasta is cooked pasta with a bite. Drain in a colander. Cook garlic:
    Return the pot to medium heat and add the olive oil, 4 garlic cloves, and
    oregano. Cook for 20 seconds, stirring constantly. Garlic cooks fast and can
    easily burn, so donâ€™t walk away. Turn off the heat. Add remaining
    ingredients: Drained pasta, tomato sauce, remaining 1/2 tsp salt, ground
    black pepper, and 1 more fresh garlic clove. Stir gently until warmed
    through."
